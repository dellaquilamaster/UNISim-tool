* Configuration file of the Sequential Decay physics model
* This model can simulate sequential reaction where, one or more of the products of the reaction 
* can decay in additional decay product.
* One of the additional decay product can decay in other decay products and so on.
* Beam and Target are usually defined in the main Unified-Simulation-tool configuration file
* Here we define exclusively the exit channel
*
* Usage example:
* P=Projectile
* T=Target
* x1,x2,...,xn = light ejectiles of the primary reaction
* X* heavy residual excited that decays into Y* + y1 + ... + ym
* P+T -> X* + x1 + x2 + ... + xn -> Y* + y1 + ... +ym + x1 + ... + xn
* Equivalently, Y* can decay into other products and so on...
* For each step of the reaction, one might have even more than 1 product decaying
*

*
* The reaction in the first step of the collision
*

define particle 0 -Z=3 -A=9 *** particle 0
define particle 1 -Z=5 -A=11 *** particle 1
*
* setting the angular distribution for particle 0 (the angular distribution is always set for the first particle of the decay)
*
*set ang_distr 0 "path_to_file"
*
*
* including some excited state of the particle 0
*
*set spectroscopy 0 -Ex=xx -Gamma=xx *** an excited state of particle 0
*set spectroscopy 0 -Ex=yy -Gamma=yy *** an excited state of particle 0
*(...)
*
* defining the decay mode of the particle 0
*
*set decay 0 0 -Z=xx -A=xx *** particle 0 of the decay of the fragment 0
*set decay 0 1 -Z=yy -A=yy *** particle 1 of the decay of the fragment 0
*

* One can also set the spectroscopy and decay mode of one of the secondary particles of the decay by using e.g. set spectroscopy 0_0 or 0_1 or set decay 0_0 or 0_1 and so on
* Particle numbers have always to start with 0. So one might set for instance the decay of the particle 0_1 in the particles 0, 1, 2 and 3.
