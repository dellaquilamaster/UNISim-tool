* 9Li @ 10B
*
* The reaction in the first step of the collision
*

define particle 0 -Z=3 -A=9 *** particle 0
define particle 1 -Z=5 -A=10 *** particle 1

*
* setting the angular distribution for particle 0 (the angular distribution is always set for the first particle of the decay)
*
*set ang_distr 0 "path_to_file"
*
*
* including some excited state of the particle 0
*
* What ih gamma is not known?
* gamma is in same unit as Ex, if less than keV - gamma = 0.0
*
** 9Li as 0

*set spectroscopy 1 -Ex=6.129 -Gamma=0.0 *** an excited state of particle 0
*set spectroscopy 1 -Ex=6.56 -Gamma=0.0252 *** an excited state of particle 0
*set spectroscopy 1 -Ex=6.875 -Gamma=0.12 *** an excited state of particle 0

*
* defining the decay mode of the particle 0
*
*set decay 0 0 -Z=xx -A=xx *** particle 0 of the decay of the fragment 0
*set decay 0 1 -Z=yy -A=yy *** particle 1 of the decay of the fragment 0
*

* One can also set the spectroscopy and decay mode of one of the secondary particles of the decay by using e.g. set spectroscopy 0_0 or 0_1 or set decay 0_0 or 0_1 and so on
* Particle numbers have always to start with 0. So one might set for instance the decay of the particle 0_1 in the particles 0, 1, 2 and 3.
