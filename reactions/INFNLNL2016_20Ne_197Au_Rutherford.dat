*
* Configuration file of the Rutherford Scattering physics model
* This model can simulate the elastic scattering with an angular distribution that follows the 
* pure Rutherford cross section.
* Beam and Target are usually defined in the main Unified-Simulation-tool configuration file
* Here we define exclusively the exit channel
*
* Usage example:
* P=Projectile
* T=Target
* P+T->P+T
*

*
* 20Ne + 197Au -> 20Ne + 197Au at INFN-LNL (2016)
*

define particle 0 -Z=10 -A=20 *** elastically scattered 20Ne
define particle 1 -Z=79 -A=197 *** recoiling target

set min_angle 5 *** minimum scattering angle in degrees
